# README
This repo helps build virtual machines using packer on ESXi hosts.

- [x] Build on a simple network with a basic DHCP server, no need for additional configuration. 
- [x] Doesn't use TFTP server for netbooting.
- [x] Doesn't use a separate HTTP server.
- [x] Built-in HTTP templating server.
- [x] Build a working container.
- [x] Gracefully handle CTRL+C.

**Pre-requisites**
- vSphere ESXi host with SSH enabled.

**Supported VM Build Automation**

# Getting started
1. Setup the `blob` folder with vendor files.
1. Run `mount_iso_folders.sh` to mount ISO files to a path local `iso_contents` folder.
1. Create a `config.yml` file.

## Running `build.sh`
1. Run `build.sh` script with extra arguments `-o`, `-v`, and `-n`.
1. It will build a container image and map into the volume the `config.yml` and the `blob` directory.
1. It will start the virtual machine build process.

## config.yml
The `config.yml` file is used by the virtual machine build process.

```yaml

build:
  server: vsphere-1  # esx host
  user: builder # esx user with admin permissions
  password: password # esx user's password
  network: VM Network # virtual network to create the VM on
  datastore: nvme1 # the datastore to create the VM on

vm:
  user: guest # the VM user
  password: password # the VM password

blob:
  dir: blob # the folder path of the vendor files
...
```
